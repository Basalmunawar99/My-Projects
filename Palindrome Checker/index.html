<p class="ok">A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards,<br>
    ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. <br> Common examples include "racecar," "level," and "A man, a plan,
     a canal: Panama!" <br> Palindromes demonstrate the playful nature of language and can be found in various forms,
     <br> from simple words to complex sentences. <br>
   They challenge our perception of symmetry and can be a fun linguistic puzzle to solve.</p>
